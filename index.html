    <h1> Croissant </h1>

    <p> The Croissant (from French croissant (de lune) = waxing crescent moon ), HÃ¶rnchen,  Beugel, Kipferl (in Bavaria and Austria ), Cornetto (in Italy )
         or also (in Switzerland ) [der(das)] Gipfel(i) 
         is a French pastry made from a lightly sweetened, egg-based yeast dough that is topped with a few layers of fat.
          Croissants are therefore classified as Danish pastries. Good croissants have a matt, shiny, tender, crispy crust and a flaky crumb . </p>
